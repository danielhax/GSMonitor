# GSMonitor
Game Servers Monitor

Pretty self explanatory, a GUI for the traditional 'ping' CLI command.

Aimed to hopefully be useful to gamers who wants a small application that constantly monitors their pings in the servers the play on.

Check out my pretty new blog: watideas.wordpress.com

Please, leave comments, suggestions and criticisms about the program or the blog or both if you find it interesting!

Thanks!
